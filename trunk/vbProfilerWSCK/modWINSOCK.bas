If you are calling the SetService function with the dwNameSpace parameter set to a specific service name, the network service name can be a common name or a distinguished name.

Note that In general, the data pointed to by the BLOB structure's pBlobData member must not contain any pointers. That is because only the network service knows the format of the data; copying the data without such knowledge would lead to pointer invalidation. If the data pointed to by pBlobData contains variable-sized elements, offsets from pBlobData can be used to indicate the location of those elements. There is one exception to this general rule: when pBlobData points to a SERVICE_TYPE_INFO_ABS structure.

' The Windows Sockets accept function permits an incoming connection attempt on a socket.
'
' Parameters:
' ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
' s       [in]  Descriptor identifying a socket that has been placed in a listening state with the listen function. The connection is actually made with the socket that is returned by accept.
' addr    [out] Optional pointer to a buffer that receives the address of the connecting entity, as known to the communications layer. The exact format of the addr parameter is determined by the address family that was established when the socket was created.
' addrlen [out] Optional pointer to an integer that contains the length of addr.
'
' Return:
' ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
' If no error occurs, accept returns a value of type SOCKET that is a descriptor for the new socket. This returned value is a handle for the socket on which the actual connection is made.
' Otherwise, a value of INVALID_SOCKET is returned, and a specific error code can be retrieved by calling WSAGetLastError.

' Minimum Availability : Windows Sockets 1.1 or later (not supported on Windows 95/98)
'
' Description:
' ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
' The Windows Sockets AcceptEx function accepts a new connection, returns the local and remote address, and
' receives the first block of data sent by the client application.
'
' Note : This function is a Microsoft-specific extension to the Windows Sockets specification. For more
' information, see Microsoft Extensions and Windows Sockets 2.
'
' Parameters:
' ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
' sListenSocket         [in]  Descriptor identifying a socket that has already been called with the listen function. A server application waits for attempts to connect on this socket.
' sAcceptSocket         [in]  Descriptor identifying a socket on which to accept an incoming connection. This socket must not be bound or connected.
' lpOutputBuffer        [in]  Pointer to a buffer that receives the first block of data sent on a new connection, the local address of the server, and the remote address of the client. The receive data is written to the first part of the buffer starting at offset zero, while the addresses are written to the latter part of the buffer. If this parameter is set to NULL, no receive will be performed, nor will local or remote addresses be available through the use of GetAcceptExSockaddrs function calls.
' dwReceiveDataLength   [in]  Number of bytes in lpOutputBuffer that will be used for actual receive data at the beginning of the buffer. This size should not include the size of the local address of the server, nor the remote address of the client; they are appended to the output buffer. If dwReceiveDataLength is zero, accepting the connection will not result in a receive operation. Instead, AcceptEx completes as soon as a connection arrives, without waiting for any data.
' dwLocalAddressLength  [in]  Number of bytes reserved for the local address information. This value must be at least 16 bytes more than the maximum address length for the transport protocol in use.
' dwRemoteAddressLength [in]  Number of bytes reserved for the remote address information. This value must be at least 16 bytes more than the maximum address length for the transport protocol in use.
' lpdwBytesReceived     [out] Pointer to a DWORD that receives the count of bytes received. This parameter is set only if the operation completes synchronously. If it returns ERROR_IO_PENDING and is completed later, then this DWORD is never set and you must obtain the number of bytes read from the completion notification mechanism.
' lpOverlapped          [in]  An OVERLAPPED structure that is used to process the request. This parameter must be specified; it cannot be null.
'
' Return:
' ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
' If no error occurs, the AcceptEx function completed successfully and a value of TRUE is returned.
' If the function fails, AcceptEx returns FALSE. The WSAGetLastError function can then be called to
' return extended error information. If WSAGetLastError returns ERROR_IO_PENDING, then the operation

' ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
' s       [in] Descriptor identifying an unconnected socket.
' name    [in] Name of the socket to which the connection should be established.

' Return:

' If no error occurs, connect returns zero. Otherwise, it returns SOCKET_ERROR, and a specific error code
' can be retrieved by calling WSAGetLastError.
'
' On a blocking socket, the return value indicates success or failure of the connection attempt.
'
' With a nonblocking socket, the connection attempt cannot be completed immediately. In this case, connect
' will return SOCKET_ERROR, and WSAGetLastError will return WSAEWOULDBLOCK. In this case, there are three
' possible scenarios:
'   - Use the select function to determine the completion of the connection request by checking to see if
'     the socket is writeable.
'   - If the application is using WSAAsyncSelect to indicate interest in connection events, then the
'     application will receive an FD_CONNECT notification indicating that the connect operation is
'     complete (successfully or not).
'   - If the application is using WSAEventSelect to indicate interest in connection events, then the
'     associated event object will be signaled indicating that the connect operation is complete
'     (successfully or not).
' Until the connection attempt completes on a nonblocking socket, all subsequent calls to connect on the
' same socket will fail with the error code WSAEALREADY, and WSAEISCONN when the connection completes
' successfully. Due to ambiguities in version 1.1 of the Windows Sockets specification, error codes returned
' from connect while a connection is already pending may vary among implementations. As a result, it is not
' recommended that applications use multiple calls to connect to detect connection completion. If they do,
' they must be prepared to handle WSAEINVAL and WSAEWOULDBLOCK error values the same way that they handle
' WSAEALREADY, to assure robust execution.
' If the error code returned indicates the connection attempt failed (that is, WSAECONNREFUSED,
' SAENETUNREACH, WSAETIMEDOUT) the application can call connect again for the same socket.

' GetAddressByName
'
' Minimum Availability : Requires Windows Sockets 1.1 (Obsolete for Windows Sockets 2.0)
'
' Description:
' ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
' The GetAddressByName function queries a name space, or a set of default name spaces, in order to obtain
' network address information for a specified network service. This process is known as service name resolution.
' A network service can also use the function to obtain local address information that it can use with the bind
' function.
'
' The functions detailed in Protocol-Independent Name Resolution provide equivalent functionality in Windows
' Sockets 2.
'
' Important : The GetAddressByName function is a Microsoft-specific extension to the Windows Sockets 1.1
' specification. This function is obsolete. For the convenience of Windows Sockets 1.1 developers, the
' reference material is as follows.
'
' Parameters:
' ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
' dwNameSpace           [in]     Specifies the name space, or a set of default name spaces, that the operating system will query for network address information.  Use one of the following constants to specify a name space: NS_DEFAULT, NS_DNS, NS_NETBT, NS_SAP, NS_TCPIP_HOSTS, NS_TCPIP_LOCAL
'                                 Most calls to GetAddressByName should use the special value NS_DEFAULT. This lets a client get by with no knowledge of which name spaces are available on an internetwork. The system administrator determines name space access. Name spaces can come and go without the client having to be aware of the changes.
' lpServiceType         [in]     Pointer to a globally unique identifier (GUID) that specifies the type of the network service. The header file Svcguid.h includes definitions of several GUID service types, and macros for working with them.
' lpServiceName         [in]     Pointer to a zero-terminated string that uniquely represents the service name. For example, "MY SNA SERVER".  Setting lpServiceName to NULL is the equivalent of setting dwResolution to RES_SERVICE. The function operates in its second mode, obtaining the local address to which a service of the specified type should bind. The function stores the local address within the LocalAddr member of the CSADDR_INFO structures stored into *lpCsaddrBuffer.
'                                 If dwResolution is set to RES_SERVICE, the function ignores the lpServiceName parameter.
'                                 If dwNameSpace is set to NS_DNS, *lpServiceName is the name of the host.
' lpiProtocols          [in]     Pointer to a zero-terminated array of protocol identifiers. The function restricts a name resolution attempt to name space providers that offer these protocols. This lets the caller limit the scope of the search. If lpiProtocols is NULL, the function obtains information on all available protocols.
' dwResolution          [in]     Set of bit flags that specify aspects of the service name resolution process. The following bit flags are defined: RES_SERVICE, RES_FIND_MULTIPLE, RES_SOFT_SEARCH
' lpServiceAsyncInfo    [in]     Reserved for future use; must be set to NULL.
' lpCsaddrBuffer        [out]    Pointer to a buffer to receive one or more CSADDR_INFO data structures. The number of structures written to the buffer depends on the amount of information found in the resolution attempt. You should assume that multiple structures will be written, although in many cases there will only be one.
' lpdwBufferLength      [in,out] Pointer to a variable that, upon input, specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by lpCsaddrBuffer.  Upon output, this variable contains the total number of bytes required to store the array of CSADDR_INFO structures. If this value is less than or equal to the input value of *lpdwBufferLength, and the function is successful, this is the number of bytes actually stored in the buffer. If this value is greater than the input value of *lpdwBufferLength, the buffer was too small, and the output value of *lpdwBufferLength is the minimal required buffer size.
' lpAliasBuffer         [out]    Pointer to a buffer to receive alias information for the network service. If a name space supports aliases, the function stores an array of zero-terminated name strings into the buffer pointed to by lpAliasBuffer. There is a double zero-terminator at the end of the list. The first name in the array is the service's primary name. Names that follow are aliases. An example of a name space that supports aliases is DNS.  If a name space does not support aliases, it stores a double zero-terminator into the buffer.  This parameter is optional, and can be set to NULL.
' lpdwAliasBufferLength [in,out] Pointer to a variable that, upon input, specifies the size, in bytes, of the buffer pointed to by lpAliasBuffer.  Upon output, this variable contains the total number of bytes required to store the array of name strings. If this value is less than or equal to the input value of *lpdwAliasBufferLength, and the function is successful, this is the number of bytes actually stored in the buffer. If this value is greater than the input value of *lpdwAliasBufferLength, the buffer was too small, and the output value of *lpdwAliasBufferLength is the minimal required buffer size.  If lpAliasBuffer is NULL, lpdwAliasBufferLength is meaningless and can also be NULL.
'
' Return:

'
' Minimum Availability : Windows Sockets 1.1 or later (Not supported on Windows 95)
'
' Description:
' ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
' The Windows Sockets TransmitFile function transmits file data over a connected socket handle. This
' function uses the operating system's cache manager to retrieve the file data, and provides high-
' performance file data transfer over sockets.
'
' Note : This function is a Microsoft-specific extension to the Windows Sockets specification. For more
' information, see Microsoft Extensions and Windows Sockets 2.
'
' Parameters:
' ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
' hSocket               [in] Handle to a connected socket. The TransmitFile function will transmit the file data over this socket. The socket specified by hSocket must be a connection-oriented socket; the TransmitFile function does not support datagram sockets. Sockets of type SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_SEQPACKET, or SOCK_RDM are connection-oriented sockets.
' hFile                 [in] Handle to the open file that the TransmitFile function transmits. Since operating system reads the file data sequentially, you can improve caching performance by opening the handle with FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN. The hFile parameter is optional; if the hFile parameter is NULL, only data in the header and/or the tail buffer is transmitted; any additional action, such as socket disconnect or reuse, is performed as specified by the dwFlags parameter.
' nNumberOfBytesToWrite [in] Number of file bytes to transmit. The TransmitFile function completes when it has sent the specified number of bytes, or when an error occurs, whichever occurs first.  Set nNumberOfBytesToWrite to zero in order to transmit the entire file.
' nNumberOfBytesPerSend [in] Size of each block of data sent in each send operation, in bytes. This specification is used by Windows sockets layer. To select the default send size, set nNumberOfBytesPerSend to zero.  The nNumberOfBytesPerSend parameter is useful for message protocols that have limitations on the size of individual send requests.
' lpOverlapped          [in] Pointer to an OVERLAPPED structure. If the socket handle has been opened as overlapped, specify this parameter in order to achieve an overlapped (asynchronous) I/O operation. By default, socket handles are opened as overlapped.  You can use lpOverlapped to specify an offset within the file at which to start the file data transfer by setting the Offset and OffsetHigh member of the OVERLAPPED structure. If lpOverlapped is NULL, the transmission of data always starts at the current byte offset in the file.  When lpOverlapped is not NULL, the overlapped I/O might not finish before TransmitFile returns. In that case, the TransmitFile function returns FALSE, and GetLastError returns ERROR_IO_PENDING. This enables the caller to continue processing while the file transmission operation completes. Windows will set the event specified by the hEvent member of the OVERLAPPED structure, or the socket specified by hSocket, to the signaled state upon completion of the data transmission request.
' lpTransmitBuffers     [in] Pointer to a TRANSMIT_FILE_BUFFERS data structure that contains pointers to data to send before and after the file data is sent. Set the lpTransmitBuffers parameter to NULL if you want to transmit only the file data.
' dwFlags               [in] The dwFlags parameter has six settings: TF_DISCONNECT, TF_REUSE_SOCKET, TF_USE_DEFAULT_WORKER, TF_USE_SYSTEM_THREAD, TF_USE_KERNEL_APC, TF_WRITE_BEHIND
'
' Return:
' ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
' If the TransmitFile function succeeds, the return value is TRUE. Otherwise, the return value is FALSE.
'
' To get extended error information, call GetLastError. The function returns FALSE if an overlapped I/O
' operation is not complete before TransmitFile returns. In that case, GetLastError returns ERROR_IO_PENDING.

' As in the case of the select and WSAAsyncSelect functions, WSAEventSelect will frequently be used to

' following sequence of operations is possible:
'   - Data arrives on socket s; Windows Sockets sets the WSAEventSelect event object.
'   - The application does some other processing.
'   - While processing, the application issues an ioctlsocket(s, FIONREAD...) and notices that there is data ready to be read.
'   - The application issues a recv(s,...) to read the data.
'   - The application eventually waits on the event object specified in WSAEventSelect, which returns immediately indicating that data is ready to read.
'   - The application issues recv(s,...), which fails with the error WSAEWOULDBLOCK.

' ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
' hLookup          [in]      Handle returned from the previous call to WSALookupServiceBegin.
' dwControlFlags   [in]      Flags to control the next operation. Currently only LUP_FLUSHPREVIOUS is defined as a means to cope with a result set which is too large. If an application does not wish to (or cannot) supply a large enough buffer, setting LUP_FLUSHPREVIOUS instructs the provider to discard the last result setwhich was too largeand move on to the next set for this call.
' lpdwBufferLength [in, out] On input, the number of bytes contained in the buffer pointed to by lpqsResults. On output, if the function fails and the error is WSAEFAULT, then it contains the minimum number of bytes to pass for the lpqsResults to retrieve the record.
' lpqsResults      [out]     Pointer to a block of memory, which will contain one result set in a WSAQUERYSET structure on return.

'
' Blocking hooks are generally used to keep a single-threaded GUI application responsive during calls to
' blocking functions. Instead of using blocking hooks, an application should use a separate thread
' separate from the main GUI thread) for network activity.
'
' Parameters:
' ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
' lpBlockFunc [in] A pointer to the procedure instance address of the blocking function to be installed.
'
' Return:
' ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
' The return value is a pointer to the procedure-instance of the previously installed blocking function.
' The application or library that calls the WSASetBlockingHook() function should save this return value

' Minimum Availability : Requires Windows Sockets 1.1
'
' Description:
' ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
' The Windows Sockets WSAStartup function initiates use of Ws2_32.dll by a process.
'
' Parameters:
' ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
' wVersionRequested [in]  Highest version of Windows Sockets support that the caller can use. The high-order byte specifies the minor version (revision) number; the low-order byte specifies the major version number.
' lpWSAData         [out] Pointer to the WSADATA data structure that is to receive details of the Windows Sockets implementation.
'
' ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
' In order to support future Windows Sockets implementations and applications that can have functionality
' differences from the current version of Windows Sockets, a negotiation takes place in WSAStartup. The caller
' of WSAStartup and the Ws2_32.dll indicate to each other the highest version that they can support, and each
' confirms that the other's highest version is acceptable. Upon entry to WSAStartup, the Ws2_32.dll examines
' the version requested by the application. If this version is equal to or higher than the lowest version
' supported by the DLL, the call succeeds and the DLL returns in wHighVersion the highest version it supports
' and in wVersion the minimum of its high version and wVersionRequested. The Ws2_32.dll then assumes that the
' application will use wVersion. If the wVersion parameter of the WSADATA structure is unacceptable to the
' caller, it should call WSACleanup and either search for another Ws2_32.dll or fail to initialize.
'
' It is legal and possible for an application written to this version of the specification to successfully
' negotiate a higher version number version. In that case, the application is only guaranteed access to
' higher-version functionality that fits within the syntax defined in this version, such as new Ioctl codes
' and new behavior of existing functions. New functions may be inaccessible. To get full access to the new
' syntax of a future version, the application must fully conform to that future version, such as compiling
' against a new header file, linking to a new library, or other special cases.
'
' This negotiation allows both a Ws2_32.dll and a Windows Sockets application to support a range of Windows
' Sockets versions. An application can use Ws2_32.dll if there is any overlap in the version ranges. The
' following table shows how WSAStartup works with different applications and Ws2_32.dll versions.
